**Which modeling framework (e.g., logical, flux balance, etc.) is the target needed for?**
If possible, please provide a SBO term for the modeling framework (e.g., `SBO_0000624` for flux balance).

**Which simulation algorithms (e.g., FBA, FVA, etc.) is the target needed for?**
If possible, please provide KiSAO terms for the algorithms (e.g., `KISAO_0000526` for FVA).

**Which simulation outputs would you like to be able to record with SED-ML?**
Please briefly describe the outputs you would like to be able to record (e.g., for FVA, the minimum and maximum flux of each reaction).

**What targets do you suggest for addressing these outputs?**
Please suggest a canonical target for these outputs (e.g., for FVA, `sbml:reaction/@minFlux`, `sbml:reaction/@maxFlux`).
